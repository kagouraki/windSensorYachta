The Android app was programmed with [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?locale=en). Programming is very simple and is done graphically using blocks. The file with the extension * .aia can be loaded into MIT App Inventor and processed further. The apk file is used for installation under Android.

The security precautions are increased under Android 11 and the apk file cannot be downloaded and installed directly on the mobile phone. An installation is then refused and the file type is changed. To install third-party software outside of the PlayStore, the apk file must be transferred to the downloads folder on the mobile phone via a USB connection. The Android app can then be installed via the file manager. 

{- This App is only usable for the wiFi 1000 firmware -}
