## Windsensor Yachta

The initial idea for the Yachta wind sensor is based on a work by the user Yachta. He presented and published the wind sensor on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2261719). Udo took up the idea of ​​Yachta and modified the mechanics a little. The arms of the cup wheel have been separated. This makes 3D printing easier to implement. The electronics were completely redesigned by him. The microcontroller was removed and replaced with an ESP8266. A DC/DC converter module was installed so that the wind sensor can also be operated at 12V. The circuit board was created with the Windows software Sprint Layout and converted into Gerber files. Now is a new BCP available from Norbert.

The PCB project is listed on [Open Source Hardware Lab](https://oshwlab.com/) an can be edited with the webbased online [layout program EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/norbert-walter/projects).

The board without components can be ordered from [Aisler](https://aisler.net/p/VTNPJWKQ) or direct in EasyEDA.

There are different firmware for the wind sensor. Both Udo and Julian ([Jukolein](https://github.com/jukolein/NMEA0183-Windsensor)) have created their own firmware versions with different functionality. Udo has also designed another wind sensor, which is a further development of the Yachta wind sensor. The functional principle and the electronics are identical. But you need a different board because the wind sensor is slimmer. Julian published the whole thing on [Github](https://github.com/jukolein/NMEA0183-Windsensor) and wrote his own firmware for the wind sensor, which can also be used for this wind sensor. 

The WiFi 1000 firmware is a firmware that can be used universally for various wind sensors and was originally developed by Norbert for the [WiFi 1000 wind sensor](https://gitlab.com/norbertwalter67/Windsensor_WiFi_1000). The current versions of the firmware can be found in the respective own repositories at Github and GitLab.

A lively exchange of experiences takes place in the German-speaking [sailing forum](https://www.segeln-forum.de/board194-boot-technik/board195-open-boat-projects-org/79131-windsensor-ii-iii/). You can also participate in English.

## How can I use it?

I use the windsensor in combination with [OpenPlotter](http://www.sailoog.com/openplotter) on a Raspberry Pi 3B. OpenPlotter serves as access point for WiFi devices. The windsensor connects to OpenPlotter via WiFi and transmits the NMEA0183 data telegrams every second. The windsensor sends NMEA0183 telegrams. Check here [link](http://www.nmea.de/nmea0183datensaetze.html) for more information.

A Android App is also available. It is is a WebApp connecting directly to the windsensor to display all data.
