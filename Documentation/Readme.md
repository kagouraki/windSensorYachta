## Information

An illustrated assembly instruction can be found in the folder [Picutures/Yachta_Thingiverse](https://gitlab.com/norbertwalter67/windsensor_yachta/-/tree/main/Pictures/Yachta_Thingiverse). Due to the changes made by Udo, there are small deviations in the instructions from Yachta. But it shouldn't cause any problems to assemble the wind sensor.
